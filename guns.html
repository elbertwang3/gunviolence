					<p>In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. to date, the gun control debate has sparked again. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-u-s-has-never-been-so-polarized-on-guns/">America has never been more divided on guns</a>. Yet our collective interest in gun control only lasts for a couple weeks after an incident like this one, and just as the memory of those who passed fades, so too does our anger subside about how easy it is to obtain guns in America--long before any meaningful bipartisan legislation can be passed into law. We'd rather choose to forget and move on than face the uncomfortable reality of why we continue to die to guns in America.  </p>

						<h3> Interest in "gun control" from Sandy Hook to Vegas </h3>
					</div>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p> After the Sandy Hook shooting, in which 20 children and 6 staff members were shot at their elementary school, interest in gun control spiked. The incident, which brought then President Barack Obama to tears, led to executive actions from Obama and twow pieces of legislation. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) sponsored the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013, which would've banned the import, sale, and possession of semiautomatic assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices, and Senators Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey sponsored the bi-partisan Manchin-Toomey Amendment, which would've required background checks on most private gun sales. Both failed. The Assault Weapons Ban would've banned weapons like those used in the Orlando Massacre and the Las Vegas shooting. </p>

					<p> In late February, Trump repealed the Obama-era rule that would've barred certain mentally ill people from buying guns to little fanfare. Despite <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/23/bipartisan-support-for-some-gun-proposals-stark-partisan-divisions-on-many-others/">bipartisan agreement</a> in preventing the mentally ill from purchasing guns and enforcing background checks for private gun sales, Republican lawmakers have voted against any type of gun control, including measures for which there is Republican support. Below is a map of how the House voted on the resolution. </p>

					<div id="votemap">
						<h3> How Congress voted on H.J.Res. 40: 235-180</h3>
						<p> In general, congressmen voted along party lines for this resolution, and a simple majority was enough for it to pass. In a House with a strong Republican majority, almost all Republican representatives voted to pass the bill, save two from New York. Six Democrats with centrist ideologies from mostly red states--Arizona, Texas, and Georgia--voted Aye, departing from party lines. The bill would've added only 75,000 people--those who receive Social Security checks for a mental illness and those who are unable to handle their own financial affairs--to a national background check database, potentially preventing them from buying guns. It's unclear whether Obama's bill could've prevented any recent mass shootings, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/upshot/gun-deaths-are-mostly-suicides.html"> more than half of gun deaths in the U.S. are suicides</a>, and <a href="https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/"> guns account for about half of all suicides</a>. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div id="massshootingmap">
						<h3> Mass shootings in 2017</h3>
						<p>From the beginning of 2017 to the Las Vegas shooting, there have been 272 mass shootings in the U.S. The Gun Violence Archive defines mass shooting as the FBI does--"FOUR or more shot and/or killed in a single event [incident], at the same general time and location, not including the shooter." Mass shootings on this scale and frequency don't occur anywhere else. Indeed, we have a mass shooting problem, with a <a href="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2858772c-a7e1-11e7-ab55-27219df83c97?source=next&fit=scale-down&width=700">disproportionate amount</a> of the world's mass shooters relative to our population. Yet it's hard to hone in on exactly who these perpetrators are and what makes them turn to violence. Laws that take guns out of the hands of responsible gun owners will never pass in the U.S., so we need to understand mass shooters to begin to draft legislation to prevent them from obtaining guns. </p>




						
					</div>
					<p> It's hard for the media to ignore an incident like Las Vegas, but when looking at the data, mass shootings of this scale are relatively uncommon. According to the Gun Violence Archive, in 2005, less than half of 1 percent of gun deaths were killed in a mass shooting. Still, incidents like Vegas help shine a light on the larger problem of gun violence in the U.S.</p>

					<p> Most gun violence and gun deaths in the U.S. are caused by specific individuals living in at-risk neighborhoods in the U.S. According to a piece by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/jan/09/special-report-fixing-gun-violence-in-america">The Guardian</a>, "these neighborhood areas contain just 1.5% of the country’s population, [but] they saw 26% of America’s total gun homicides." On the map, you can identify these areas by the concentration of shootings in one cluster.These are mostly neighborhoods in metropolitan areas with high poverty rates and a majority of African-Americans--neighborhoods for which crime and gun violence are symptoms of larger socioeconomic issues stemming from decades of racial segregation. Zooming in even further, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/homicide-in-new-orleans/">"3 to 7 percent of the population of those neighborhoods is responsible for 50 to 60 percent of those shootings"</a>, an effect called the law of crime concentration, and the victims of those shootings are just as likely to be the perpetrators.


				
					<p>	Gun control therefore must not be the only solution. D.C., a city with one of the strictest gun laws in the U.S., had the mass shootings per capita in 2017 by far. D.C. Although D.C. requires permits for guns, bans assault weapons, and restricts magazine capacities, these gun laws are bandaids that fail to address the root of the problem: the racism, poverty, and inequality that the city faces. In New Orleans, LA, whose homicide rate has surpassed Chicago's, the grassroots Youth Empowerment Project (YEP) is providing an education, mentoring, and employment opportunities to at-risk youth to suppress gun violence at the root. </p>

						<h3> Do guns kill people or do people kill people? </h3>
						
					</div>
					<br>

					<p>Both. There is a clear correlation between the percent of the population that owns guns and the number of gun deaths per capita. Correlation doesn't imply causation, but the relationship between the two is strong. The easier it is to access guns, the more likely there will be accidents, suicides, and homicides by guns. In at-risk neighborhoods, existing criminal activity and the multitude of guns is the perfect recipe for gun violence. </p>
					<p>There are some outliers like such as South Dakota--states with a higher gun ownership percentage but comparatively less gun deaths. South Dakota is also more homogenous racially and socioeconomically, and it has a relatively lower fraction of the population living under the poverty line, falling in line with the theory that poverty and inequality can predict gun violence. Alaska and Wyoming are exceptions to this rule. These two states have but some of the <i>lowest</i> percentages of populations living under the poverty line, yet they also have the most guns per capita and most gun deaths. The reason? <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/suicide-in-wyoming/">Suicide</a>. In contrast to the high homicide rate in cities, rural Alaska and Wyoming have the highest suicide rates in the country, driven by a culture of self-reliance and an abundance of guns.</p>

						<h3> Guns in the U.S. vs. the rest of the developed world</h3>
							<p> Compared to the rest of the developed world, the U.S. has the most guns per capita by far, which isn't a surprise, but several European countries also have a fair number of guns, especially parts of Scandinavia. Yet one of the fundamental differences between guns here and in Europe is that in general, Americans view guns as a form of self-defense, whereas Europeans view them as an object for sport and hunting. This difference partially explains a weaker correlation between guns and gun deaths in Europe. Most of those countries fall below the regression line--they have relatively fewer gun deaths given the amount of guns they have.</p>

					</div>
					<br>
					
					<p> Take Iceland for example. The nation has around 90,000 guns for a population of 300,000, yet gun violence there is almost nonexistent. In Iceland, to obtain a gun you would need a license, conditional upon having no criminal record, passing a medical evaluation by a doctor, taking a course and a written exam on gun safety, and owning a proper gun safe to put weapons in. The difference is that other countries view gun ownership as a privilege rather than a right, and therefore they thoroughly vet gun applicants for histories of mental illnesses and violence to make sure all gun owners are responsible owners. No mass shooting will change the culture of guns in the U.S. and our unshakeable belief in our right to own them, but we can take steps to craft policies that prevent guns from falling into the hands of individuals unqualified and unfit to handle them. </p>

					<p> Still, these laws may be circumvented like they were in Norway in 2011. In the graph, Norway has a disporportionate amount of gun deaths compared to the number of guns due to the 2011 attacks carried out by right-wing extremist Anders Behring Breivik. Though gun ownership is strictly regulated by the state through the Firearm Weapons Act in Norway, Breivik went through the steps to obtain all of his weapons--mainly semi-automatic ones--through legal channels. He killed 77 people in total. Yet incidents like these are still <a href="https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NA-CH404_SHOOTR_9U_20151004180908.jpg">comparatively rare</a> abroad because guns are so tightly regulated there. Admittedly, given the unique set of racial and socioeconomic problems here and a cultural rift on the purpose of guns, comparing the U.S. with other countries on gun control is like comparing apples to oranges.

					<h3> Where to go from here </h3>
					
					<p> To move forward, lawmakers do need to take steps to implement policies that <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/23/bipartisan-support-for-some-gun-proposals-stark-partisan-divisions-on-many-others/ft_17-06-21_gunsparty/">both sides agree on</a>. But more effective than a sweeping gun control law, we need to specifically target the different types victims affected by gun violence. The majority of gun deaths come from suicides, especially by older men in rural areas. The U.S. has suicide rates on par with many other developed countries, so if we take away their guns, these people may still find other ways to commit suicide. The government must better provide mental health resources to prevent suicides from occurring in the first place. </p>

					<p>  The next largest group of gun deaths comes from homicides in at-risk neighborhoods, and the <a href="https://www.campbellcollaboration.org/library/pulling-levers-focused-deterrence-strategies-effects-on-crime.html">"pulling levers" deterrence strategy</a> has shown promise in this demographic. By identifying offenders and coordinating law enforcement with community resources to communicate incentives and disincentives to those offenders, we can provide alternatives and second chances to those most at risk for becoming perpetrators and victims of gang-related gun violence.</p>

					<p> As with Las Vegas, the nation has come together again after another mass shooting to mourn and lament the lack of gun control in here. Yet gun control alone will not solve gun violence, a symptom of larger issues at hand. We must also tackle problems like mental illness, political extremism, and inequality at the grassroots level <i>in addition</i> to implementing gun control measures to stifle gun violence at its root and treat and prevent it altogether.
