					<p>In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. to date, the gun control debate has sparked again. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-u-s-has-never-been-so-polarized-on-guns/">America has never been more divided on guns</a>. Yet our collective interest in gun control only lasts for a couple weeks after an incident like this one, and just as the memory of those who passed fades, so too does our anger subside about how easy it is to obtain guns in America--long before any meaningful bipartisan legislation can be passed into law. We'd rather choose to forget and move on than face the uncomfortable reality of why we continue to die to guns in America.  </p>

						<h3> Interest in "gun control" from Sandy Hook to Vegas </h3>
					</div>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p> After the Sandy Hook shooting, in which 20 children and 6 staff members were shot at their elementary school, interest in gun control spiked. The incident, which brought then President Barack Obama to tears, led to executive actions from Obama and twow pieces of legislation. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) sponsored the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013, which would've banned the import, sale, and possession of semiautomatic assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices, and Senators Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey sponsored the bi-partisan Manchin-Toomey Amendment, which would've required background checks on most private gun sales. Both failed. The Assault Weapons Ban would've banned weapons like those used in the Orlando Massacre and the Las Vegas shooting. </p>

					<p> In late February, Trump repealed the Obama-era rule that would've barred certain mentally ill people from buying guns to little fanfare. Despite <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/23/bipartisan-support-for-some-gun-proposals-stark-partisan-divisions-on-many-others/">bipartisan agreement</a> in preventing the mentally ill from purchasing guns and enforcing background checks for private gun sales, Republican lawmakers have voted against any type of gun control, including measures for which there is Republican support. Below is a map of how the House voted on the resolution. </p>

					<div id="votemap">
						<h3> How Congress voted on H.J.Res. 40: 235-180</h3>
						<p> In general, congressmen voted along party lines for this resolution, and a simple majority was enough for it to pass. In a House with a strong Republican majority, almost all Republican representatives voted to pass the bill, save two from New York. Six Democrats with centrist ideologies from mostly red states--Arizona, Texas, and Georgia--voted Aye, departing from party lines. The bill would've added only 75,000 people--those who receive Social Security checks for a mental illness and those who are unable to handle their own financial affairs--to a national background check database, potentially preventing them from buying guns. It's unclear whether Obama's bill could've prevented any recent mass shootings, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/upshot/gun-deaths-are-mostly-suicides.html"> more than half of gun deaths in the U.S. are suicides</a>, and <a href="https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/"> guns account for about half of all suicides</a>. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div id="massshootingmap">
						<h3> Mass shootings in 2017</h3>
						<p>From the beginning of 2017 to the Las Vegas shooting, there have been 272 mass shootings in the U.S. The Gun Violence Archive defines mass shooting as the FBI does--"FOUR or more shot and/or killed in a single event [incident], at the same general time and location, not including the shooter." Mass shootings on this scale and frequency don't occur anywhere else. Indeed, we have a mass shooting problem, with a <a href="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2858772c-a7e1-11e7-ab55-27219df83c97?source=next&fit=scale-down&width=700">disproportionate amount</a> of the world's mass shooters relative to our population. Yet it's hard to hone in on exactly who these perpetrators are and what makes them turn to violence. Laws that take guns out of the hands of responsible gun owners will never pass in the U.S., so we need to understand mass shooters to begin to draft legislation to prevent them from obtaining guns. </p>




						
					</div>
					<p> It's hard for the media to ignore an incident like Las Vegas, but when looking at the data, mass shootings of this scale are relatively uncommon. According to the Gun Violence Archive, in 2005, less than half of 1 percent of gun deaths were killed in a mass shooting. Still, incidents like Vegas help shine a light on the larger problem of gun violence in the U.S.</p>

					<p> Most gun violence and gun deaths in the U.S. are caused by specific individuals living in at-risk neighborhoods in the U.S. According to a piece by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/jan/09/special-report-fixing-gun-violence-in-america">The Guardian</a>, "these neighborhood areas contain just 1.5% of the country’s population, [but] they saw 26% of America’s total gun homicides." On the map, you can identify these areas by the concentration of shootings in one cluster.These are mostly neighborhoods in metropolitan areas with high poverty rates and a majority of African-Americans--neighborhoods for which crime and gun violence are symptoms of larger socioeconomic issues stemming from decades of racial segregation. Zooming in even further, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/homicide-in-new-orleans/">"3 to 7 percent of the population of those neighborhoods is responsible for 50 to 60 percent of those shootings"</a>, an effect called the law of crime concentration, and the victims of those shootings are just as likely to be the perpetrators.


				
					<p>	Gun control therefore must not be the only solution. D.C., a city with one of the strictest gun laws in the U.S., had the mass shootings per capita in 2017 by far. D.C. Although D.C. requires permits for guns, bans assault weapons, and restricts magazine capacities, these gun laws are bandaids that fail to address the root of the problem: the racism, poverty, and inequality that the city faces. In New Orleans, LA, whose homicide rate has surpassed Chicago's, the grassroots Youth Empowerment Project (YEP) is providing an education, mentoring, and employment opportunities to at-risk youth to suppress gun violence at the root. </p>

						<h3> Do guns kill people or do people kill people? </h3>
						
					</div>
					<br>

					<p>Both. There is a clear correlation between the percent of the population that owns guns and the number of gun deaths per capita. Correlation doesn't imply causation, but the relationship between the two is strong. The easier it is to access guns, the more likely there will be accidents, suicides, and homicides by guns. In at-risk neighborhoods, existing criminal activity and the multitude of guns is the perfect recipe for gun violence. </p>
					<p>There are some outliers like such as South Dakota--states with a higher gun ownership percentage but comparatively less gun deaths. South Dakota is also more homogenous racially and socioeconomically, and it has a relatively lower fraction of the population living under the poverty line, falling in line with the theory that poverty and inequality can predict gun violence. Alaska and Wyoming are exceptions to this rule. These two states have the most guns per capita and most gun deaths, but some of the lowest percentages of populations living under the poverty line. The reason? <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/suicide-in-wyoming/">Suicides</a>. In contrast to the high homicide rate in cities, rural Alaska and Wyoming have the highest suicide rates in the country, driven by a culture of self-reliance and an abundance of guns.</p>

						<p> make it toggle between Us and non-US</p>
						<p>More guns, more homicides. Iceland, European countries have a lot of guns as well, but it's very controlled.Europe also has a lot of mitigating factors like homogeneity, less social class stratification/racial tension that inhibit violence. Gun control is something we can control, but the U.S. has a unique breed of social problems combined with the ease of access of guns that make it particuarly disposed to gun violence.

						<h3> World firearms and homicides data, UNODC </h3>
						<p>	The U.S. certainly seems to have a <i>problem</i>, but it's hard to pin down exactly what it is. Do we have too many guns? Are we allowing guns to get into the hands of the wrong people? Should we ban only certain types of guns? Is it necessarily a <i>gun</i> problem?</p>
						<table id="table">
						
						</table>
						<p> Looking at the chart, it's no surprise the U.S. has the most total firearms and firearms per capita. </p>

						<p> OK, after looking at the table, the U.S. does have the most guns in the world, but when adjusted per capita, it does not have that much more than other developed countries in Scandinavia, etc. So what's the difference? Why do they have so much fewer homicides?
							Iceland = no class stratification, most people are middle class
							acquiring a gun = medical examination and written test
							no hard drugs
							problem might not be guns themselves 
							2/3 of gun deaths are suicides, out of 36,000 gun deaths
							1/3 homicides, most of whom are young black men
							remaining are accidents</p>

					<p> responsible gun owners</p>
					<p> Mass shootings so seldom happen in other countries not because they have developed carefully crafted policies against shootings, but because they have instituted broad policies to restrict guns.</p>
					<p> Because they regard gun ownership as a privilege rather than a right, they screen much more carefully not only for criminal records, but for histories of addiction, mental health treatment, and domestic violence. They test whether applicants for gun licenses can in fact, and not just in self-assessment, handle their weapons responsibly. </p>

					<p> Conclusion: need stronger gun laws and background checks but also other things that are harder to solve: poverty
